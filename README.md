# FirstApp

My first ever App created using React Native. Studies shows most people are not productive because of "friction." Finding right clothes, shoes before gym, finding where to sit before reading or simply just pushing themselves to do a task. So I created an app that given a task list, it randomly generates a task for you to do and pushes you to do it regardless of your situation.

I had experience with React but learning how somethings are different were an incredible journey. I kept adding more stuff such as modal (React native as a built in Modal component) and localStorage (React native is called AsyncStorage) for storing previous saved lists. There's more things to add but for now I think I'll leave this as this.
